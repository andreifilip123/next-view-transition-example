# Styling Guide

The application uses a combination of Tailwind CSS and CSS modules for styling.

## Tailwind CSS

- Utility-first CSS framework configured in [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts)
- Used for layout, spacing, colors, and responsive design
- Example classes:
  - `grid grid-cols-3` for three-column layout
  - `relative h-full` for full-height containers
  - `object-contain` for image scaling

## CSS Modules

- Custom animations and transitions are defined in [app/animations.module.css](mdc:app/animations.module.css)
- Used for complex animations that can't be achieved with Tailwind alone

## Image Handling

Images use Next.js's Image component with specific configurations:
- `fill` prop for parent-relative sizing
- `object-contain` for proper scaling
- `sizes="33vw"` for responsive image loading
- `priority` prop for important above-the-fold images
