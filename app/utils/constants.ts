    content: `We've added a feature flag to enable the new experimental View Transitions API in React. This new API allows you to animate between different views and components in your application.

We've overhauled the UI and presentation of error messages in Next.js, making them easier to understand. The new design highlights the core details of the error‚Äîsuch as the message, the relevant code frame, and the call stack‚Äîwhile reducing noise from code in libraries or dependencies. This means you can quickly get to the root of what went wrong and start fixing it faster.

Leveraging the newly introduced owner stacks feature in React, we're now able to provide higher fidelity into where your errors are coming from. Next.js will now be able to surface the subcomponent responsible for throwing the error, skipping over intermediary elements that weren't responsible for creating the element that caused the error.

We're also making it easier to customize your indicator preferences without needing to add additional configuration.

    content: `We‚Äôre working on a simple and powerful caching model for Next.js. In a previous post, we talked about our journey with caching and how we‚Äôve arrived at the 'use cache' directive.

This post will discuss the API design and benefits of 'use cache'.

Behind the scenes, Next.js transforms this code into a server function due to the 'use cache' directive. During compilation, the ‚Äúdependencies‚Äù of this cache entry are found and used as part of the cache key.

For example, id becomes part of the cache key. If we call getUser(1) multiple times, we return the memoized output from the cached server function. Changing this value will create a new entry in the cache.
